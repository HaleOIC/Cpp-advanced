# Effective Cpp

This repository contains my learning process about the most famous book in C++ field, `Effective C++`, which introduces a lot of coding tricks to my brain. It contains the following parts:

1. Accustoming yourself to C++
2. Constructor, destructor and assignment operators
3. Resource management
4. Design and declaration
5. implementations
6. Inheritance and Obeject-Oriented Design
7. Templates and Generic Programmings
8. Customizing new and delete
9. Miscellany

It really affect my thinking process and make my coding style cpp version, not just in `C with STL` layer. I love this book, it really enlights my programming language research and exploration.
